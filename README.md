# Stanford Machine Learning Course Exercises

One of my goals for the summer was to get more exposure to machine learning so I decided to accomplish that by going through the Machine Learning course offered by Coursera. 

At a high level each exercise covers a different topic within ML.  

**Exercise**| Topic
:-----:|:-----:
Exercise 1| Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
Exercise 2| Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent
Excercise 3| Multi-Classification with Logistic Regression and Neural Networks

(I'll be updating this table as I make progress through the course)
